[Example app](http://transactions.meteor.com/) showing the "transactions" package in action. [Package repo here](https://github.com/JackAdams/meteor-transactions).

There is a larger production app, [Standbench](http://www.standbench.com/), that uses this package, but you can't really see the package in action as you need to autheticate first.
